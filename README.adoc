=== Getting Started

This template is designed to be used as a base for your showroom lab guides.

In order to test and develop on your local machine, you can use a specially built container with Podman or Docker as follows.

[source,sh]
----
podman run --rm --name antora -v $PWD:/antora -p 8080:8080 -i -t ghcr.io/juliaaano/antora-viewer
----

> Note: If using a rootless podman replace `-v $PWD:/antora` with `-v $PWD:/antora:z`

If you make changes to the content, all you need is to kill the container and run it again.

Live-reload is not supported.

The content is built using Antora, a static site generator for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
